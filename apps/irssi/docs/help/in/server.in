@SYNTAX:server@

     -4, -6: specify explicitly whether to use IPv4 or IPv6 address
     -auto: Automatically connect to server at startup (default)
     -noauto: Don't connect to server at startup
     -silcnet: Specify the network this server belongs to
     -host: Specify what host name to bind to, if you have multiple interfaces
     -!: don't autojoin channels
     -port: This is pretty much like the port argument later, 
            except this can be used to modify existing server's 
            port.

/SERVER disconnects the server in active window and connects 
to the new one. It will take the same arguments as /CONNECT. 
If you prefix the address with the + character, Irssi won't 
disconnect the active server, and it will create a new window 
where the server is connected (ie. /window new hide;
/connect address)

/SERVER without any arguments displays the list of connected 
        servers.

/SERVER REMOVE <address> [<port>]
