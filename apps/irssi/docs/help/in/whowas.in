@SYNTAX:whowas@

This command is similar to WHOIS, except it returns
information about nicknames that were recently in use.
Like WHOIS, it shows the nickname, address, real name,
and server. It may also return multiple entries if the
nickname has been used recently by several people. These
multiples may be limited by specifying a count to show.
