@SYNTAX:getkey@

This command is used to fetch remote client's or server's public
key.  When fetching client's public key it is fetched from the
server the client is connected to.  The server has verified that the
client posesses the corresponding private key as well.  You will be
prompted to verify and accept the fetched public key.  The public key
is saved into your local key directory (~/.silc/clientkeys/).
