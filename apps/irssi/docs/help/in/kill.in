@SYNTAX:kill@

This command can be used for two purpose:  SILC operator may use it to
remove a client from the network, or user may use it to remove its own
client entries from the network.  If you are not SILC operator you cannot
use this command to remove anybody else except yourself from the network.
Only SILC operator is able to kill other clients from the network.

Killing own client entry from network:

When killing your own client entry you must provide -pubkey option to the
command. For killing your own client from network you also must be
connected to the same server as your own client entry (the client entry
may be for example detached client entry).  If you are not connected to
the same server you won't be able to kill the client.  Also, if you have
changed or lost your old public key pair you won't be able to kill the
client.

Killing as SILC Operator:

Before killing you must elevate your privileges to SILC Operator by using
the /SILCOPER command.  After that you can kill a client.  When using this
command as SILC operator -pubkey option has no effect and can be omitted.

Examples:

        /KILL myself -pubkey

            Kill yourself with nickname "myself" from network.

        /SILCOPER user
        /KILL someclient You have been killed

            Become SILC operator and kill client named
            "someclient", with comment "You have been killed".
