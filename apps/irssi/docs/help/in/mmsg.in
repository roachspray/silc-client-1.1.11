MMSG [<-sign>] [<-channel>] <target> <file> [<type>  [<encoding>]]

Sends a private data message to other user in the network.  The message
will be send as a MIME encoded data message.

If -channel option is provided then this command actually send channel
message to the specified channel.  The message IS NOT private message, it
is normal channel message.

If the -sign optin is provided, the message will be additionally
digitally signed and the receiver may verify it with your public key.

Messages that exceed roughly 64k will be fragmented automatically and
sent as separate messages.  The reassembly of the fragments will be done
automatically by the recipient.

If no transfer-encoding is given it defaults to binary.  If no 
content-type is given it is guessed using a MIME magic file.

NOTE: You have to have enabled perl support at compile time, and you need to
load the perl script silc-mime.pl for this to work!
