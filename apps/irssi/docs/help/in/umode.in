This command is used to manage user's own modes in the network.  Note that
some of the modes the user cannot set itself, however any mode can be
unset by the user.  The mode is added by adding + before the option(s) and
removed by adding - before the option(s).  The following user modes are
available:

    a        Unset all modes
