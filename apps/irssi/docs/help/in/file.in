@SYNTAX:file@

This command is used to tranfer files between clients.
The actual file transfer stream is sent outside SILC network
peer to peer between the clients.  Before the file transfer
begins the SILC Key Exchange protocol is performed between
the two clients to exchange key material.  This key material
is then used to secure the file transfer stream between the
clients.

The currently active file transfer sessions can be seen by
giving the FILE command without arguments.

Commands:

    SEND     <filepath> <nickname> [<local IP> [<local port>]]
                                   [-no-listener]

      Sends file transfer request to <nickname>.  This
      makes the <filepath> available to <nickname>.

      If the <local IP> is provided then the key exchange
      protocol listener will be bound to that address.  If
      <local port> is defined it is bound to that port.
      If they are not defined then the local IP address
      of your machine is used to bind the listener.

      If the -no-listener option is used the client does not
      bind locally but assumes that the <nickname> will provide
      the point of connect.  This is usefull when the sender
      is behind NAT device.

      If the <local IP> and <local port> are ommitted and the
      -no-listener option is not given, the boolean variable
      use_auto_addr will be examined.  If it is set the value
      of auto_bind_ip will be used as the IP address to bound
      the listener, the value of auto_public_ip will be the IP
      address sent to the remote client, and the auto_bind_port
      will be the port value to be bound to and sent to the remote
      client.  If auto_public_ip is unset, but auto_bind_ip is
      set, SILC client will send the auto_bind_ip variable's
      value to the remote client.

    ACCEPT  [<nickname>]

      Accepts the file transfer request and starts the file
      transfer session.  If the <nickname> is omitted the
      last received request is used.

    CLOSE    [<nickname>]

      Closes the file transfer session, or rejects
      file transfer request.  If this command is given
      during the file transfer process it will be cancelled.
