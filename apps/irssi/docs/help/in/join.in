@SYNTAX:join@

Joins a specified channel.  Note that, in SILC the #-sign is NOT
mandatory part of the channel names, and names "#foo" and "foo" will
join to two different channels.

If -cipher is provided and the channel does not exist the cipher to
secure the channel messages on the channel will be set to <cipher>.  If
the -hmac is provided and the channel does not exist the hmac to
secure the channel messages on the channel will be set to <hmac>.

If -founder is provided, and the channel's mode includes founder mode
it is possible to gain channel founder privileges at the same time
joining the channel.  If the channel has user limit, active bans,
or is invite-only channel the founder can override these conditions
and join the channel.  Only the client who set the founder mode on the
channel is able to use -founder option.

If the channel has the +C (channel public key authentication,
see /HELP CMODE) mode set then the user joining the channel must
provide the -auth option to JOIN command.  This option will attempt to
authenticate the user on the channel.  If the user's public key has
not been added to the channel's public key list, user will not be
able to join.  User may optionally provide the <pubkeyfile>,
<privkeyfile> and <privkey passphrase> to authenticate with some other
key pair than with the user's default key pair.

JOIN is aliased to J by default.
