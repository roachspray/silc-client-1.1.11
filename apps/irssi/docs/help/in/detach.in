@SYNTAX:detach@

This command is used to detach from the SILC Network without actually
loosing the SILC session in the network.  This means that the network
connection to the server is closed but the client remains in the network.
After giving this command the connection to the server is closed, and
a resume data is saved in ~/.silc/ directory.  Next time connection
is created into a server (which may be different from the original server)
the resume data is used to resume back to the network.

When this command is called the server sets a detached mode to your
client.  If other users give WHOIS to your nickname they will see that
you are detached from the network.  Also, all messages that are sent
to you will be lost since server cannot deliver them to you.
