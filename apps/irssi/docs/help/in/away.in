@SYNTAX:away@

This command marks you as being "away". It is used to tell people that 
you currently aren't paying attention to your screen. You might use it 
if you are taking a nap, in the shower, getting some food, or otherwise 
just aren't there at the moment.

By default, if someone sends you a MSG while you are away, your client 
will beep. You can turn this off by setting BEEP_WHEN_AWAY to OFF. 

If someone sends you a message when you're away the set away message
will be automatically sent back to that person.

If you send a MSG to someone who is away, you will automatically be 
notified of this. By default, you will only receive this notification 
once. If you wish to see it every time (to tell when a person is no 
longer marked away, for instance), change SHOW_AWAY_ONCE to OFF. 

You can remove your away status by using AWAY with no arguments.
