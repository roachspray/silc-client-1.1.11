@SYNTAX:whois@

Shows WHOIS information of the specified client. By default,
this is aliased to /WI.

If the -details option is used WHOIS will retrieve as detailed
information about the user as possible.  Using this option WHOIS
MAY return following information about the user:

  o User's public key
  o Business card of the user (VCard)
  o List of network services user is currently using
  o Text and/or multimedia message (MIME, image, etc)
  o User's personal mood
  o User's preferred language
  o User's preferred contact method (chat, email, etc)
  o User's timezone
  o User's geographical location
  o Information about the device user is using (computer, PDA, etc)

NOTE: It is also possible to receive other information. Note that
all users do not want to send these informations or may send only
some of the information. It also possible that none of these
informations is received.  It also possible that some server
responds to your request on the behalf of the user if the user
does not want to respond to you.  In this case the returned
information may be incomplete.

If the -pubkey option is used WHOIS will only retrieve the clients
with the corresponding public key.

If you want to send your information in WHOIS you can set the
information with ATTR command.  See HELP ATTR.
